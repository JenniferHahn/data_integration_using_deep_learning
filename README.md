# Data Integration using Deep Learning 
This github-repository provides the code for our Team Project in the fall semester 2021 at the University of Mannheim with the topic of Data Integration using Deep Learning. We will try to investigate how Transformer Models like BERT work on tasks in data integration with special focus on entity and schema matching.

The team consists of Jennifer Hahn, Jannik Reißfelder, Wafaa Ibrahim Mahmoud AbuObidalla, Kim-Carolin Lindner, Niklas Sabel, Cheng Chen, Marvin Rösel, Estelle Weinstock and Luisa Theobald.
